                <p>
                    When <b>Nelson Mandela</b> became the first democratically
                    elected president in South African history in 1994,
                    the world looked like a very different place. His
                    election was a symbol of a new birth of freedom
                    around the world. The fall of the Berlin Wall in
                    1991 and the end of the Cold War had helped spur a
                    democratic revolution not only in South Africa but
                    around the world. Between the start of the 1990s and 2005,
                    the number of democracies on the planet increased from about
                    a third of nations to nearly half. Mandela himself was a
                    global icon not only of democracy but pluralism, and his
                    triumph seemed to spell the end of an era of authoritarianism
                    and ethnic nationalism.

                <p>
                    Now, as we celebrate Mandela Day on July <small>18th—an</small> international
                    day of service—we are in the midst of a global coronavirus
                    pandemic, and democracy and pluralism are under attack in
                    every region on earth. From Poland to Turkey, from Russia
                    to Brazil, ethnic nationalism is ascendant, and authoritarian
                    leaders and autocratic regimes are undermining the ability of
                    people to vote, eroding the independence of judiciaries, curtailing
                    freedom of speech and of the press. According to the non-profit
                    Freedom House, we are in the 14th straight year of a global decline
                    in freedom. In America, not only are we suffering from the pandemic,
                    but there is a powerful national movement against racial and cultural inequities
                    , while we have a president who is closer in spirit to the racist apartheid leaders
                    whom we thought Mandela had consigned to the dustbin of history
